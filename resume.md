# Skills

## Software Development / MLOps
Software Development / MLOps skills: 
I am most skillful in machine learning and deep learning related technology. I have used Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Git, Bash, extensively in my machine learning projects. 

I have used Docker, TensorRT and ONNX for model deployment and production inference optimization in my previous role in SOCIF Limited.

I have used DvC, MLflow, and Prefect for my previous MLOps pipeline in SOCIF Limited. 

I have explored LangChain and AWS Sagemaker in my free time. I have built a ChatBot using LangChain to answer question about my resume. And I have built a dog breeds classifier using AWS Sagemaker services and implemented a whole MLOps pipeline with it as well.

I have learned SQL and C++ in school. 

I have done some personal side project of web development using JavaScript, React.js, node.js, express.js, MongoDB. I have developed a to-do list project using such stack.

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning skills: 
I am familiar with general, Deep Learning, which includes MLP, CNN, Generative AI, Large Language Model (LLM), Image Classification, Object Detection etc. 

In my previous role, I also researched Model Compression (pruning, quantization) for inference optimization.

I have used traditional machine learning algorithm like Random Forest, Boosted Tree, Linear/Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine extensively during my undergraduate study of data science.

# Projects

## People Counting Solution on Bus
Project name: People Counting Solution on Bus (most notable project)
Source: work at SOCIF Limited
Date: June 2022 to present
- Optimized object detection models for the people counting application (>95% accuracy) using model compression and custom tracking algorithm, reduced inference time by 60% and cost by 40%
- Designed and developed MLOps infrastructure for efficient re-training, model versioning, and model monitoring, enabling easy scalability in deployment across 4000+ buses

People Counting Solution on Bus is my most notable achievement professionally. It leads to a joint-venture with one of Hong Kong's largest publicly-listed corporations. The most challenging technical part is to implement an accurate solution under budget constraint. Therefore, I have done a lot of inference optimization to keep the model as lightweight as possible. I have also developed the AI application using multi-processing to have further performance gain. In addition, to manage 4000+ models with different version, I have to implement a full MLOps system to better maintain the models and applications. 

## Deep Learning Library from scratch
Project name: deep learning library from scratch
Source: Cargnie Mellon University open online course project
Date: July 2023
- Implemented an entire deep learning library loosely similar to PyTorch from scratch with backward automatic differentiation and a backend matrix library written in C++/CUDA
